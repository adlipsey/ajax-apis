# Failure is Always an Option

A simple and silly project used to practice AJAX and API's, this app will append "fail" to anything typed in the search bar, add a button with the newly searched term to the menu on the left, and display the top 10 gif results (filtered for anything rated above PG-13). Clicking a gif display the animated version, clicking again will return it to the thumbnail image. I am proud of this one purely for the amount of fun I had with the CSS.
